-- Employees can belong to multiple departments. 
-- When the employee joins other departments, 
-- they need to decide which department is their primary department. 
-- Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, 
-- their primary column is 'N'.
-- Write an SQL query to report all the employees with 
-- their primary department. For employees who belong 
-- to one department, report their only department.
-- Return the result table in any order.
-- The query result format is in the following example.



select 
employee_id, 
department_id
from Employee
where primary_flag = 'Y' or 
employee_id in (
  select 
  employee_id 
  from employee 
  group by employee_id 
  having count(department_id) = 1
)
