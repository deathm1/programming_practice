    "Inheritance in Python allows one class (the child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (the parent or base class). This promotes code reuse and helps create a hierarchy of classes. Python supports several types of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Inheritance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Single Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "In single inheritance, a class inherits from one parent class. This is the simplest form of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def parent_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in the Parent class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def child_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in the Child class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "obj = Child()\n",
    "obj.parent_method()  # Output: This is a method in the Parent class.\n",
    "obj.child_method()   # Output: This is a method in the Child class.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Multiple Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows the derived class to combine behaviors from multiple base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Father:\n",
    "    def father_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in the Father class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Mother:\n",
    "    def mother_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in the Mother class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Father, Mother):\n",
    "    def child_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in the Child class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "obj = Child()\n",
    "obj.father_method()  # Output: This is a method in the Father class.\n",
    "obj.mother_method()  # Output: This is a method in the Mother class.\n",
    "obj.child_method()   # Output: This is a method in the Child class.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Multilevel Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from a parent class, and then another class inherits from this derived class. This creates a chain of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Grandparent:\n",
    "    def grandparent_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in the Grandparent class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent(Grandparent):\n",
    "    def parent_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in the Parent class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def child_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in the Child class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "obj = Child()\n",
    "obj.grandparent_method()  # Output: This is a method in the Grandparent class.\n",
    "obj.parent_method()       # Output: This is a method in the Parent class.\n",
    "obj.child_method()        # Output: This is a method in the Child class.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "In hierarchical inheritance, multiple classes inherit from a single parent class. Each derived class can have its own methods and attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def parent_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in the Parent class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child1(Parent):\n",
    "    def child1_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in Child1.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child2(Parent):\n",
    "    def child2_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in Child2.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "obj1 = Child1()\n",
    "obj2 = Child2()\n",
    "obj1.parent_method()  # Output: This is a method in the Parent class.\n",
    "obj1.child1_method()  # Output: This is a method in Child1.\n",
    "\n",
    "obj2.parent_method()  # Output: This is a method in the Parent class.\n",
    "obj2.child2_method()  # Output: This is a method in Child2.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Hybrid Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. This can sometimes lead to complex hierarchies and is less common due to potential issues like the Diamond Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Base:\n",
    "    def base_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in the Base class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class A(Base):\n",
    "    def a_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in class A.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class B(Base):\n",
    "    def b_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in class B.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class C(A, B):\n",
    "    def c_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is a method in class C.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "obj = C()\n",
    "obj.base_method()  # Output: This is a method in the Base class.\n",
    "obj.a_method()     # Output: This is a method in class A.\n",
    "obj.b_method()     # Output: This is a method in class B.\n",
    "obj.c_method()     # Output: This is a method in class C.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**: In complex inheritance scenarios (especially with multiple and hybrid inheritance), Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the method resolution order. You can inspect the MRO of a class using `ClassName.__mro__` or `ClassName.mro()`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **The Diamond Problem**: This occurs in multiple inheritance where a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from the same base class. Python’s MRO helps to resolve potential conflicts by defining a consistent order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports various types of inheritance, each offering different benefits and complexities. Understanding these inheritance types helps in designing better class hierarchies and ensures code reusability and organization."
